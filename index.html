      If you are reading this, you have Javascript disabled.
      The table of contents on this page is loaded via Javascript.
      So it'll be a pretty empty table for you. Turn on JS if you actually
      want a list of API documentation and such. Cheers!

      If you are reading this, and it hasn't gone away in a few seconds after
      loading the page, either you have Javascript disabled (in which case
      you'd also see another warning before this one),
      or your browser is so old it doesn't support modern (ES2015+) Javascript.
      Either way, this page isn't going to work in your current browser.
