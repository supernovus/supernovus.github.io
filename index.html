      So it'll be a pretty empty table for you. Turn on JS if you actually
      want a list of API documentation and such. Cheers!

      If you are reading this, and it hasn't gone away in a few seconds after
      loading the page, either you have Javascript disabled (in which case
      you'd also see another warning before this one),
      or your browser is so old it doesn't support modern (ES2015+) Javascript.
      Either way, this page isn't going to work in your current browser.

      This page has really gotten rather out of date, as I never automated any
      of the scripts that power it. I really need to fix that, and add the
      twenty-bazillion more packages I have written in the meantime.
