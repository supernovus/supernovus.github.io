<h1>Garden -- A Functional Template Language</h1>
<h2>VERSION 1-DRAFT1</h2>
<h2>Importation</h2>
<p>
Sometimes its useful to create common namespaces, which contain templates
and dictionaries that can be shared between other namespaces. In the current
version of the specification, you can reference templates from other namespaces
from any other namespace, by using the full name of the template (including
the namespace.) However, as of version 1, there is no way to reference
dictionaries or other data from other namespaces (this is on the TODO list
for version 2.)
</p>
<p>
So in the cases where you want shared dictionaries, or in the cases where
you don't want to have to type the full name of a template, wouldn't it be
nice if you could just import the objects from one namespace into another one?
</p>
<p>
Well, you can. That's what the <code class="b">import</code> statement is for.
</p>
<h4>The import statement, in detail.</h4>
<p>
The <code class="b">import</code> statement does exactly what 
it says on the box, 
imports objects from one namespace into another. 
By default it imports templates and
dictionaries, however, it can import other data if requested. The basic
usage (importing the default objects) is simple:
</p>
<code class="block">
<b>import</b> "<i class="n">another/namespace</i>"
</code>
<p>
Yeah, that's it. You now have access to the templates and dictionaries from
<i class="n">another/namespace</i> in your current namespace. Pretty easy huh?
</p>
<p>
But that's not all. Say all of your templates are using a super custom
syntax, and you want to be able to share that syntax between all of your
namespaces without having to add all of those override statements to each
and every one of your namespace files. Well, that's where the 
<i class="f">:syntax</i> flag comes in handy:
</p>
<code class="block">
<b>import</b> "<i class="n">common</i>" <i class="f">:syntax</i>
</code>
<p>
Now, you've not only gained the templates and dictionaries from
<i class="n">common</i>, but you've imported the custom syntax rules too.
</p>
<p>
There are other flags that modify what you can import, such as the
<i class="f">:plugins</i> flag, but that's only applicable to the
Plugins extension, so we'll talk about it more when we get to that
section.
</p>
<p>
There is one other flag that the <code class="b">import</code> statement 
supports, <i class="f">:export</i>. This is a magic flag, in that it 
doesn't import anything extra, but instead changes how your namespace 
interacts with the namespace you've imported. 
See the Exportation section (coming up next) for more details on that.
