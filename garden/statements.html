<h1>Garden -- A Functional Template Language</h1>
<h2>VERSION 1-PREDRAFT3</h2>
<h2>Statements</h2>
<p>
In namespace files, only two things are parsed: statements and blocks.
We'll get to the various kinds of block later, but for now let's focus on
statements.
</p>
<p>
Before that however, a rather large and important rule. 
<strong>Any text not recognized as a statement or block, is ignored.</strong>
That's right, we don't barf, or bail, or go "what the hell is that", we just
ignore it. If it's not one of the known statements (either core, or extension),
and it's not a known block (again, core or extension), then we ignore it.
</p>
<p>
Okay, with that out of the way, let's move on to the known statements and
what they do. Note: the list below is only for Core statements. Any
statements added by extensions will be listed in the documentation for
that extension.
</p>

<h4>The version statement</h4>
<p>
Using the <code class="b">version</code> statement declares that your template
requires at least the specified version of the Garden specification in order
to be properly parsed. It's use is simple:
</p>
<code class="block">
<b>version</b> <i>1</i>
</code>
<p>
Where you replace the <i>1</i> with whatever version you are depending upon.
</p>
<p>
By specifying a version, the Garden implementation can enable certain
version-specific features, or changes to any default syntax. If you do
not specify a version statement, backwards compatibility with version 1 is
assumed. Additional features may be enabled with the lack of a version number,
but only if enabling them is backwards compatible with version 1 templates.
</p>

<h4>The use statement</h4>
<p>
Some features in Garden are optional. These are called Extensions.
There are two kinds of extensions: Recommended Extensions, and Implementation
Extensions. The first kind, as the name suggests, are recommended to be
available in every implementation, but that is not guaranteed.
In order to enable an extension, you must <code class="b">use</code> it.
It's usage is again simple:
</p>
<code class="block">
<b>use</b> <i>globals</i>
</code>
<p>
Where <i>globals</i> is the extension you want to load. A list of recommended
extensions can be found in the Customization and Extensions chapter.
</p>

<h4>The include statement</h4>
<p>
The <code class="b">include</code> statement lets you add additional folders to
the template search path. See the Importation section for more details.
</p>

<h4>The import statement</h4>
<p>
The <code class="b">import</code> statement lets you import objects from one
namespace into the current one, as well as specifying the export rules.
See the Importation and Exportation sections for more details.
</p>

<h4>The export statements</h4>
<p>
The <code class="b">no export</code> statement specifies that the namespace 
does not allow exportation into it.
</p>
<p>
The <code class="b">require export</code> statement specifies that the 
namespace cannot be used directly, and instead requires the exportation of 
other templates and dictionaries to be usable.
</p>
<p>
See the Exportaion section for further details.
</p>

<h4>Syntax override statements</h4>
<p>
We're not going to cover these here. See the Overriding Syntax for details.
The list of core language syntax overrides statements is:
</p>
<p>
<code class="b">delimiters</code>, 
<code class="b">block</code>, 
<code class="b">dictblock</code>,
<code class="b">comment</code>,
<code class="b">condition</code>,
<code class="b">alias</code>,
<code class="b">note</code>,
<code class="b">positional</code>,
<code class="b">apply</code>,
<code class="b">negate</code>.
