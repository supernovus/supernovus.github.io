# supernovus.github.io

This repository holds the files for http://supernovus.github.io/

It used to be built with some of my ancient Perl 5 libraries.
I will likely write something new to replace that at some point,
for now this will simply host a simple HTML page and some compiled
API documentation from my various Javascript and PHP libraries.

My Perl 5 and Raku (formerly Perl 6) stuff is all so old I'm not going
to bother even listing it in here.
